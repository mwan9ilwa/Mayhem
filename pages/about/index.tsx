          <h3>Inspiration</h3>
          <p>
            I didn&#39;t really have much direction on what I wanted to be
            growing up. But I have always wanted to work for Google.

          <h3>ðŸ“¸ Photography</h3>
          <p>
            Recently, I started shooting photography after learning that the Google Pixel line of products
            are great for photography. I became a Pixel fan, and I have shot with the Pixel 3 and I shoot with the Pixel 6.
            I find myself shooting portraits the most as it gives me an opportunity to connect with people and let
            them see how I see them.
